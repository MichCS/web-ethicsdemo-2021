      The New Year, 2022, will commence a new era for New York City residents. NYC will endure many changes starting January 1, 2022. Starting with, a new mayor. For the first time in 8 years, there will be a change of guards. Mayor-elect, Eric Adams will take office. While many are excited for this change, there are others who are very apprehensive. One reason, a 12 month school year is vital and should be implemented, <i>"for day-long activities, including childcare, soft skills instruction, and local STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) programming."</i>
